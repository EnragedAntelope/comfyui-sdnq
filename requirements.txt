# ComfyUI-SDNQ Dependencies
# ========================
# These are MINIMUM version requirements. We avoid specifying diffusers/transformers
# since ComfyUI typically has them pre-installed, and specifying versions can cause
# package managers (pip, uv) to downgrade dev/git versions.
#
# If you need a newer diffusers for latest models (FLUX.2, Z-Image-Turbo, etc.):
#   pip install --upgrade diffusers
# Or install from GitHub if the model isn't yet in the PyPI release:
#   pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git

# SDNQ quantization engine (includes diffusers as a dependency)
sdnq>=0.1.0

# HuggingFace Hub integration (for model downloads)
huggingface-hub>=0.20.0

# Model serialization (usually pre-installed)
safetensors>=0.4.0

# Acceleration utilities
accelerate>=0.25.0
